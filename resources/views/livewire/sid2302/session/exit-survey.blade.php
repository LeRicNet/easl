            Thank you for participating in our study. At the end of this session, we invite you to complete the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) survey.<br><br>

            NASA-TLX is a widely used subjective, multidimensional assessment tool that rates perceived workload to help us understand user experiences in various settings. It measures workload along six different dimensions: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration.<br><br>

            To complete the survey, please rate your subjective experience across these six aspects on a scale from 0 (very low) to 100 (very high). Note that there are no right or wrong answers, and your responses should reflect your own experience based on todayâ€™s session. The information you provide will be crucial to improving our processes.
